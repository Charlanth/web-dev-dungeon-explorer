# Dungeon Explorer - 2D Game
Dungeon Explorer is a simple 2D browser-based game where players navigate through a dungeon, collect treasures, and try to achieve the highest score before running out of energy. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and stores high scores locally in the browser.

## Features
WASD Movement: Move the player character using the W, A, S, D keys.

Wall Collisions: The player cannot pass through wall tiles.

Treasure Collection: Pick up treasures to increase your score.

Energy System: The player has limited energy, which depletes with movement.

Local High Score Storage: The highest score is saved in the browser's localStorage.

Simple 2D Grid-Based Dungeon: The game uses a tile-based system for walls, floors, and treasures.

## How to Play
Use W (Up), A (Left), S (Down), D (Right) to move.

Collect as many treasures as possible before running out of energy.
